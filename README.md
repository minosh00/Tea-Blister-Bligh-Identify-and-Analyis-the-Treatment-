# Tea Blister Blight Identification and Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to identify and analyze tea leaves, specifically focusing on detecting the presence of blister blight. The process involves using a Mask R-CNN model to segment tea leaves and applying K-Means clustering to analyze the damage percentage accurately.

## Features
- **Tea Leaf Segmentation:** Utilizes Mask R-CNN for precise segmentation of tea leaves in images.
- **Damage Analysis:** Applies K-Means clustering to analyze the percentage of damage on tea leaves.
- **Blister Blight Detection:** Determines whether the tea leaf has blister blight based on the analysis.
